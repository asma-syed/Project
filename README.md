Project 2 - Avanade Practical Project


BRIEF

The project requires to making an application that generates “Objects” with a service service-orientated architecture with 2 different implementations:

* Service 1: Service's frontend; renders the HTML needed to interact with the application, communicate with the other 3 services, and persists     data in an SQL database.
  
* Service 2 & 3: Generate a random “Object” such as:
            - Random number
            - Random letter
            - Pull an item from an Array
            - Pull from a .csv
            - Pull from a database
            - API call to an external AP
     
* Service 4: Creates an “Object” based upon the results of service 2 + 3 using some pre-defined rules.
  
Implementations must perform swapping out for each other seamlessly, without disrupting the user experience.


REQUIREMENTS

1. Clear documentation 
2. A Kanban boards
3. Risk assessment
4. A fully integrated app using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System.
5. Azure Pipelines 
6. Deployed using Azure 


APPROACH

Step 1

The first step taken to realise the project was to define the project management framework, Agile Scrum Framework. A Kanban board was created to identify project requirement and project backlog with user stories.
